-JDK - Java development KIt 
-JRE - Java Runtime Enviorment
-Wrapper (Class)
-Every program of java starts with a Class
- class name cannot be staeted with a number or any other special char except _ or $
- class name must be same as file name

JDK - JAVA development kit 
- it provides javadoc
- it provides java compiler
- it also provides jar/war/ear/rar
JRE - Java Runtime Enviorment
- JRE is divided into 2 parts
-- JVM - Java virtual machine (Interpreter Executes line by line code of byte code)
    actually JVM is responsible to convert byte code to machine code
-- Libraries

# Data Type
--Primitive  (int Byte long short float double char  bool)
-----Primitive means primary
-----Value type (Because it store value only)
-----Simple type (Only contain same typr of data)
-----Inspired from C , C++
-----Immutable(Does not change in the original value if we channge in Copied)
-----Static Memory Allocation
--Non Primitive (Array String Class&Obj Integer Long Float Double Byte Short)
-----Reference type( Keep Address/Reference)(Address could be of 4 byte (32bit) or 8 byte(64 bit))
-----Complex type (Contain many type of data like a bag)
-----Dynamic Memory Allocation
--Keywords
-----Keywords are reserve words,Compiler knows these so it know how much memory is to allocate for primitive, this is get decided on compile time.
-----Start with small letter 

--Heap (Storage space Made by java to store all object)
-----Stronng pool(Inside Heap there is a special area where java store string called Stronng pool)

--String 
-----(String is a collection of caharacter )
-----String is a predefined Java Class
-----String also behave like data type
-----String obj can be created in 2 ways
-----a)Literal way(1 or 0 way)
-----b)new object way (2 or 1 obj)
-----String store in String pool
-----String is a final class in Java (No one can inherit)
-----String obj are Immutable
-----intern()
        when you weite String a = "Amit" -> Internally it is converted into
        String a = "Amit".intern()
        intern is a method in a string, this method is used to check the string exist in a pool or not. It gives the reference of a string in a pool


Q. How to build a muttable string and how it did that? (H/W)
Sol :- We can Use Class StringBuilder or StringBuffer to create mutable String.
        StringBuilder Creates a seq of char (Known as Array of char)


Q.What is the diff between string builder and string buffer? (H/W)
Sol:- --String Builder is Faster then StringBuffer
      --StringBilder is not synchronized where StringBuffer is Synchronized 

--H/W:
    input : aMIt sRiVaStaVA
    Output: Amit Srivastava 
    Hint : Use String Method
    There is only two methods are available about String Case 1 is toLower 2 is toUpper So we can not perform the question only through method

    Q2:
        input: ram@yahoo.com
        Output: true,False
        Ask:- If @ comes more than one time or the domain is something else  other than .com will the email valid
